# United States Flights Delay Prediction

Welcome to the **United States Flights Delay Prediction** repository! This project aims to predict flight delays across the United States using machine learning techniques, based on historical flight data. The goal is to help airlines, passengers, and other stakeholders make informed decisions by providing insights into potential delays.

## Overview
Air travel delays can disrupt schedules, cause economic losses, and negatively impact passenger experience. This project uses data-driven methods to predict delays, offering an opportunity to minimize disruptions and improve efficiency.

Key aspects of this project include:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on flight data.
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
- Model development for delay prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance.

## Dataset
The project utilizes publicly available flight data from the United States. 

### Data Sources:
- [US 2023 Civil Flights, Delays, Meteo, and Aircrafts Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bordanova/2023-us-civil-flights-delay-meteo-and-aircraft)

### Data Description:
- **Flight Information**: Departure and arrival times, origin and destination airports, flight distance.
- **Weather Conditions**: Average temperature, wind speed, precipitation, etc.
- **Delay Data**: Details about delays caused by weather, carrier, NAS, security, and other factors.
- **Aircraft Details**: Manufacturer, model, and aircraft age.

The dataset was processed into a star schema structure to facilitate efficient analysis and querying.

## Technical Details

### Data Warehouse and ETL
- The dataset was processed using **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)** to construct a star schema, consisting of dimension tables (e.g., weather, aircraft, airports) and a fact table for flight details.
- ETL steps included data cleaning, transformation, and loading into a database.

### Analysis and Reporting
- **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)** was used to create cubes and perform multidimensional analysis.
- **MDX Queries** were run to extract insights, such as identifying the most delayed cities and busiest airports.

### Visualization
- Dashboards were created using **Power BI** and **Excel Pivot** to present findings interactively.

## Results and Insights

### Key Findings:
1. **Most Delayed Cities**: Identified the top 3 cities with the highest average departure delays for each state.
2. **Airline Performance**: Ranked airlines by their average delay times and total flights in 2023.
3. **Monthly Delay Patterns**: Found months with the highest average delays exceeding 15 minutes.
4. **Weather Impact**: Quantified delays caused by weather conditions such as precipitation and wind speed.

### Visualizations:
- A variety of charts, including bar graphs, line plots, and pie charts, were created to highlight delay trends and contributing factors.
